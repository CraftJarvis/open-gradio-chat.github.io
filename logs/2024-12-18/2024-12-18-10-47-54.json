However, they can only be mined with an iron pickaxe or better. Using a stone pickaxe (or any pickaxe made of a material weaker than iron) will not yield any diamonds.\n\nThe reason for this is that diamonds are one of the hardest materials in Minecraft. They require a certain level of mining power to be successfully extracted. An iron pickaxe provides the necessary strength to break through the diamond ore block and collect the diamond item.\n\nUsing a stone pickaxe on diamond ore will simply result in the ore block being destroyed without dropping any diamonds. This is why it's important to use the correct tool for the job when mining for valuable resources like diamonds in Minecraft.\n",
