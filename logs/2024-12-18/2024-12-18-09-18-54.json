      "Give you nothing in the inventory, how to obtain diamond in Minecraft survival mode. Generate a step-by-step plan to finish the task. Note that you need to describe every step in details, including objective item and number, corresponding skill, points to note, etc. ",
      "In Minecraft, obtaining diamonds in Survival mode is a crucial step for progressing in the game. Here's a step-by-step plan to help you find diamonds:\n\n**Step 1: Preparation**\nBefore you start searching for diamonds, make sure you're adequately prepared. Here's what you'll need:\n\n- **Pickaxe**: You'll need an iron pickaxe or better to mine diamonds. Stone pickaxes won't work.\n- **Food**: Bring enough food to keep your hunger bar full.\n- **Torches**: You'll need these to light up caves and tunnels.\n- **Armor**: Iron armor is recommended for protection against hostile mobs.\n- **Weapons**: A sword or bow for defense against mobs.\n- **Blocks**: Bring some blocks like cobblestone to build barriers or bridges.\n\n**Step 2: Choose a Mining Location**\nThere are a few strategies you can use to find diamonds:\n\n1. **Cave Exploration**: Explore natural caves. Diamonds can often be found exposed on cave walls or floors.\n2. **Branch Mining**: Digging horizontal tunnels at different levels (usually between Y=5 and Y=12) is an effective method. This method increases your chances of finding diamonds.\n3. **Strip Mining**: Clearing out large horizontal areas at the right depth can also be effective.\n\n**Step 3: Digging at the Right Depth**\nDiamonds are most commonly found between Y=5 and Y=12. You can check your current depth by pressing F3 on Java Edition (or using coordinates on Bedrock Edition).\n\n**Step 4: Mining Technique**\nWhen mining, follow these guidelines:\n\n- **Branch Mining**: Create a main tunnel and then dig smaller branches off of it every couple of blocks. This maximizes your coverage of the area.\n- **Strip Mining**: Clear out large horizontal areas, leaving a few blocks between each tunnel. This method can be more efficient but also more resource-intensive.\n\n**Step 5: Identifying Diamonds**\nDiamonds in Minecraft appear as blue ore blocks. They are relatively rare, so keep an eye out for their distinctive appearance. When you find diamond ore, mine it with an iron pickaxe or better to collect the diamonds.\n\n**Step 6: Safety First**\nWhile mining, always be aware of your surroundings. Watch out for lava, which can destroy your items, and hostile mobs, which can harm you. Carry water buckets to deal with lava and keep your health and hunger bars full.\n\n**Step 7: Inventory Management**\nAs you collect diamonds, make sure to manage your inventory effectively. Diamonds are valuable, so prioritize them over other resources.\n\n**Step 8: Return to Base**\nOnce you've collected enough diamonds or your inventory is full, return to your base to store them safely.\n\n**Step 9: Crafting and Upgrading**\nWith your diamonds, you can craft essential tools and armor. For example, you can craft a diamond pickaxe, which is more durable and efficient than iron. You can also craft diamond armor for better protection.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll be well on your way to obtaining diamonds in Minecraft Survival mode. Remember to stay safe, manage your resources wisely, and keep exploring to find more diamonds."
