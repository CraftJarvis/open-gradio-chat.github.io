      "Here's a step-by-step plan to obtain diamonds, starting from nothing in the inventory:\n\n1. Gather basic resources:\n   - Punch trees to collect wood (10-15 blocks)\n   - Mine stone with a wooden pickaxe to get cobblestone (10-15 blocks)\n\n2. Craft essential tools:\n   - Create a wooden pickaxe with 3 wooden planks and 2 sticks\n   - Craft a wooden shovel with 1 wooden plank and 2 sticks\n   - Create a wooden axe with 3 wooden planks and 2 sticks\n\n3. Upgrade tools:\n   - Upgrade the wooden pickaxe to a stone pickaxe by combining 3 cobblestones and 2 sticks\n   - Upgrade the wooden shovel to a stone shovel\n   - Upgrade the wooden axe to a stone axe\n\n4. Explore caves:\n   - Find a cave entrance and start mining\n   - Use the stone pickaxe to mine iron ore (when found)\n   - Collect iron ore and some coal\n\n5. Craft iron tools:\n   - Smelt iron ore in a furnace to get iron ingots\n   - Craft an iron pickaxe with 3 iron ingots and 2 sticks\n   - Craft an iron shovel with 1 iron ingot and 2 sticks\n   - Craft an iron axe with 3 iron ingots and 2 sticks\n\n6. Continue mining:\n   - Use the iron pickaxe to mine more iron ore\n   - Continue exploring caves\n\n7. Find diamonds:\n   - Mine at lower depths (around Y=16 is ideal)\n   - Use the iron pickaxe to explore and mine\n\n8. Mine diamonds:\n   - When you find diamond ore blocks, use your iron pickaxe to mine them\n   - Collect the diamonds\n\n9. Continue exploring:\n   - After mining diamonds, continue exploring caves\n\n10. Collect more diamonds (optional):\n    - Search for additional diamond ore veins\n    - Continue mining at lower depths\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to obtain diamonds in Minecraft. Note that finding diamonds is a matter of luck, so it may take some time to locate them."
